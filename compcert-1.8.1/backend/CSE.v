(** * Value numbering *)

(** The idea behind value numbering algorithms is to associate
  abstract identifiers (``value numbers'') to the contents of registers
  at various program points, and record equations between these
  identifiers.  For instance, consider the instruction
  [r1 = add(r2, r3)] and assume that [r2] and [r3] are mapped
  to abstract identifiers [x] and [y] respectively at the program
  point just before this instruction.  At the program point just after,
  we can add the equation [z = add(x, y)] and associate [r1] with [z],
  where [z] is a fresh abstract identifier.  However, if we already
  knew an equation [u = add(x, y)], we can preferably add no equation
  and just associate [r1] with [u].  If there exists a register [r4]
  mapped with [u] at this point, we can then replace the instruction
  [r1 = add(r2, r3)] by a move instruction [r1 = r4], therefore eliminating
  a common subexpression and reusing the result of an earlier addition.

  Abstract identifiers / value numbers are represented by positive integers.
  Equations are of the form [valnum = rhs], where the right-hand sides
  [rhs] are either arithmetic operations or memory loads. *)

  If [op] is a move instruction, we simply assign the value number of
  the source register to the destination register, since we know that
  the source and destination registers have exactly the same value.
  This enables more common subexpressions to be recognized. For instance:
<<
     z = add(x, y);  u = x; v = add(u, y);

(** * The static analysis *)

  but is defined here because we need it to define the ordering over
  numberings used in the static analysis. 

  A numbering is satisfiable in a given register environment and memory
  state if there exists a valuation, mapping value numbers to actual values,
  that validates both the equations and the association of registers
  to value numbers. *)

(** The transfer function for the dataflow analysis returns the numbering
  ``after'' execution of the instruction at [pc], as a function of the
  numbering ``before''.  For [Iop] and [Iload] instructions, we add
  equations or reuse existing value numbers as described for
  [add_op] and [add_load].  For [Istore] instructions, we forget
  all equations involving memory loads.  For [Icall] instructions,
  we could simply associate a fresh, unconstrained by equations value number
  to the result register.  However, it is often undesirable to eliminate
  common subexpressions across a function call (there is a risk of 
  increasing too much the register pressure across the call), so we
  just forget all equations and start afresh with an empty numbering.
  Finally, the remaining instructions modify neither registers nor
  the memory, so we keep the numbering unchanged. *)

(** The static analysis solves the dataflow inequations implied
  by the [transfer] function using the ``extended basic block'' solver,
  which produces sub-optimal solutions quickly.  The result is
  a mapping from program points to numberings.  In the unlikely

  empty numberings to all program points, which is semantically correct
