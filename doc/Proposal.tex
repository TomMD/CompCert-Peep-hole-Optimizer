\title{Design and Development of a Verified Peep-hole Optimizer for CompCert}

\author{Thomas M. Du{B}uisson, Andrew Sackville-West}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
Modern compilers are so focused on performance and portability that
correctness is almost a second class citizen.  When looking only at
the GNU Compiler Collection and Low Level Virtual Machine projects,
the CSmith project~\cite{Yang11} discovered over 325 bugs where the
compilers would produce incorrectly behaving programs.

Fortunately a compiler was developed with the opposite priorities; the
CompCert~\cite{Leroy-backend} compiler uses a computer assisted theorem
prover to ensure its compiler is correct.  The downside to CompCert is
performance.  Even from casual inspection of the resulting
instructions from a CompCert compilation shows there is clearly
``low-hanging fruit'' -- opportunities to notably improve performance.

We propose to add a provably correct peep-hole optimizer to the last
stage of CompCert compilation, the stage in which individual assembly
instructions are selected.  For ease of development, we will target
the x86 CompCert back-end.

\section{Approach}
% o Approach.  Are you doing experimental comparison, implementation,
%              or a research paper survey?  What methodology will you
%              use?

A variety of techniques are proposed for translation validation --
{\it a posteriori} validation of the results of a program
transformation \cite{2008-Tristan-Leroy-POPL}. The register allocation work done by
Rideau and Leroy~\cite{Rideau-Leroy-regalloc} utilizes reverse information flow
analysis to validate register allocation and spilling transformations
performed by untrusted code. Our first area of investigation will
attempt to apply this technique to peep-hole optimizations performed
by untrusted Caml code.  The CompCert framework will run the untrusted
optimizer on x86 assembly code to acquire a {\it possibly correct}
optimization.  Our CompCert additions will attempt to prove the
optimized assembly has the same semantic meaning as the input provided
to the optimizer.  A failure to prove the semantic correctness results
in the non-optimized assembly being used for the final compilation.

\section{Deliverables}
% o Deliverables.  What do you plan to hand in?  Just a paper?
%                  Experimental results? Code?
There are three main deliverables: a method of proving two assembly
routines have the same semantic meaning, an implementation of the
proof in the CompCert framework, and a peep-hole optimizer in Caml.
The fact that the actual transformation is an optimizer (vs an
obfuscation, or a restructuring \`a la Native Client) is expected to
be immaterial to the proof method; as a result, the optimizer will
likely consist of relatively few, trivial transformations and only
expanded given sufficient time. Should this technique prove tractable,
then additional optimizations can be added to the untrusted Caml code
